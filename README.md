[00:09.74] Well Ali Baba had them forty thieves
[00:12.31] Scheherezad-ie had a thousand tales
[00:14.73] But master you in luck 'cause up your sleeves
[00:17.37] You got a brand of magic never fails
[00:19.55] You got some power in your corner now
[00:22.05] Some heavy ammunition in your camp
[00:24.40] You got some punch, pizzazz, yahoo and how
[00:26.86] See all you gotta do is rub that lamp
[00:29.00] And I'll say
[00:30.09] Mister Aladdin, sir
[00:31.76] What will your pleasure be?
[00:34.48] Let me take your order
[00:36.18] Jot it down
[00:36.92] You ain't never had a friend like me
[00:38.82] No no no
[00:40.07] Life is your restaurant
[00:41.96] I'm your maître d'

[00:46.56] You ain't never had a friend like me
[00:48.51] Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service
[00:51.66] You're the boss
[00:52.48] The king, the shah
[00:54.06] Say what you wish

[00:56.43] How about a little more Baklava?

[01:01.50] Try all of column "B"
[01:03.98] I'm in the mood to help you dude
[01:06.44] You ain't never had a friend like me
[01:17.79] Can your friends do this?
[01:20.43] Do your friends do that?
[01:22.88] Do your friends pull this out their little hat?
[01:27.91] Can your friends go, poof?
[01:30.36] Well, looky here
[01:32.55] Can your friends go, Abracadabra, let 'er rip
[01:35.86] And then make the sucker disappear?
[01:38.22] So doncha sit there slack jawed, buggy eyed
[01:40.65] I'm here to answer all your midday prayers
[01:42.83] You got me bona fide, certified
[01:45.42] You got a genie for your chargé d'affaires
[01:47.74] I got a powerful urge to help you out
[01:50.20] So what-cha wish? I really wanna know
[01:52.40] You got a list that's three miles long, no doubt
[01:54.71] Well, all you gotta do is rub like so - and oh
[01:57.82] Mister Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three
[02:02.03] I'm on the job, you big nabob
[02:04.69] You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend
[02:06.78] You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend
[02:09.37] You ain't never had a friend like me
[02:21.55] You ain't never had a friend like me, hah!
